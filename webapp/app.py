ANN Savings Calculator - Flask Web Application

This Flask application serves as the web interface for the ANN-based savings
prediction system. It provides a user-friendly web interface where users can
input their financial information and receive AI-powered insights about their
spending patterns, saving potential, and goal achievement likelihood.

Key Features:
- RESTful API for financial predictions
- Interactive web interface with real-time charts
- Input validation and error handling
- Personalized recommendations and rewards system
- Responsive design for all devices

Endpoints:
- GET /: Main application interface (HTML)
- POST /api/predict: Financial prediction API (JSON)
